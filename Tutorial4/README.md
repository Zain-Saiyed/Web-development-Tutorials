## Sources Used

### LoginPage.tsx

*Lines 25*

```javascript
const check_if_email_is_valid  = (str: string) => /^([A-Za-z\._]+)@([A-Za-z]+)\.([A-Za-z]+)$/.test(str);
```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [PANDAQUESTS](https://pandaquests.medium.com/5-easy-ways-to-check-if-a-string-contains-only-numbers-in-javascript-305db38625e8#:~:text=const%20isNumber%20%3D%20str%20%3D%3E%20!,a%20string%20only%20contains%20numbers.) as shown below: 

```javascript
const onlyContainsNumbers = (str) => /^\d+$/.test(str);
```

- The code in [PANDAQUESTS](https://pandaquests.medium.com/5-easy-ways-to-check-if-a-string-contains-only-numbers-in-javascript-305db38625e8#:~:text=const%20isNumber%20%3D%20str%20%3D%3E%20!,a%20string%20only%20contains%20numbers.) was implemented by panda quest to show the different ways to perform check if a string contains number. This was the first method and was flexible because of its regex implementation.

And, using a for loop instead is not a good design approach for checking presence of numebrs in string. Hence, the inspiration was taken fomr teh source.

## Acknowledgement

For inspiration of the unicode:

### Profile.tsx and UserProfilePage.tsx

* **Profile.tsx** : *Lines 96 - 102*
* **UserProfilePage.tsx** : *Lines 31 - 37*

```javascript
{/* Display active status */}
{user_profile.isActive ? (
    // [1] The unicode for green ball from: https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+1F7E2
    <Typography style={{ display:'inline-block', fontWeight:'bold', color: 'green', marginLeft:'10px'}}>ðŸŸ¢ Active</Typography>
) : (
    // [2] The unicode for gray ball from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71565351/what-is-the-unicode-code-for-a-grey-ball
    <Typography style={{ display:'inline-block', fontWeight:'bold', color: 'black', marginLeft:'10px' }}>âš« Inactive</Typography>
)}
```

* Instead of using a react icon downlaoding dependency I used the unicode of the *Green Ball* on [Compart](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+1F7E2) for showing the online active status.
* Similarly, I used the unicode of the *Gray Ball* on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71565351/what-is-the-unicode-code-for-a-grey-ball) for showing the offline in-active status.
